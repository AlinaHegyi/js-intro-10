GIT: Global Information Tracker
  -it allows programmer to work together on a project collaboratively
  -it stores our project using a hosting platform with all its versions 


Hosting platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps and many more.
GitHub: by individuals to create public projects and market themselves


VCS: Version Control System 

Git is VCS.
Git is distributed VCS ()

Centralized VCS: we dont prefer this, when server is down we can't push our changes
Distributed VCS we have a local copy of the server repo and can keep working 
even though there is an issue with the server


SSH KEY
It is special type of authentication used instead of user and password
it is more secure and use private-public key pairs
Public is shared with hosting apps while private is in your local

ssh-keygen  -simpliest ssh set up
