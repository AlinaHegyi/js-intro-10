29/7  JS FUNCTIONS

function: method and behaviour of an object-template-class-prototype
         -is a block of code we execute for a task

  {} - it's a block


REUSABLE:  one of the biggest advantage of creating functions
   Breaking down your program into manageable pieces.

   We'll give meaningful indentifiers for functions


CREATING A FUNCTION - points tp comsider whem creatimng a function

 1. Task - what it does
 2. Give it a meaningful funcName3
 3. Parameters or arguments
 4. Return type or void - what it returns if it's a return type method
 5.static or non-static

If a method is static it is called with it's object
   Math.max()
    Number.isInteger()

    NON-STATIC
  'Hello'.toUpperCase()

function funcName(arg1, arg2, arg3) {
    // this is the block of the code
  
}

funcName();

void: do not return any value
return-type: these methods return something


let fullname =  'john Doe';

const words = fullname.split(' '); // [ 'john', 'Doe' ]









we are batch-10

Last word always start with the last space and goes untill the end.
