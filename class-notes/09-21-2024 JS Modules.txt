  static methods and properties can be accessed with the className while non-static ones can be accessed
  with an object of the class.

  class A {
    static propertyA 'Hi';
   propertyB = 'Hello'; 
    }

static funcA() {
    console.log('I am static');

}

funcB () {
    console.log('I am not static');
}


//ACCESING STATIC PROPERTIERS

Apple.propertyA; // 'Hi'
Apple.funcA(); // 'I am static'



const1 = new Apple;

If the method executes the same task for every single object
of the class it makes sense to use static methods.



class Batch10Student {
    constructor(fullname, age) {
    this.fullname = fullname;
    this.age = ade;
    }

  static getprogramNmae() {
    return 'SDET';
  }

  getFullName() {
    return this.fullName;
  }

  getAge() {
    return this.age;
  }
}


const bermet = new Batch10Student('Bermet S', 20);

const alina = new Batch10Student('Alina', 21);

bermet.getFullname();

Batch10Student.getProgramName();



class AppleStore {

  constructor(id, city, state, zip) {

  }

  static getIphone16ProMaxPrice() {

  }

}







HTML = HyperText Markup Language
It is not a programming language because you can't create functions with it.



Web Application: any app you visit on browsers
Mobile Application: Any app you download from AppStore or GooglePlay
Hybrid Application: You can use on web and also install on your mobile devices

Desktop application: Robot framework (Python)


Web application: it consists of many web pages
Each web page is created using HTML
Each web page is created using web elements

Each web element is represented by an HTML tag
 <p>/p<
 <img/>
 <div></div>

 <button>Apply Now</button>
 opening tag : <button>Apply
 closing tag:  /button>

 Opening and closing tag / self closing tag <img/>


 Tags may have many properties/attributes.
  All the properties are added as key-value pairs in opening tags

 <tagName>
